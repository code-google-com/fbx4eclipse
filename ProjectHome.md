This packages includes an command line application for
converting Bioware's Eclipse engine models from the native format to something that can be manipulated or used a reference for non-derivative works.  The Eclipse Engine is currently used for Dragon Age: Origins.

Currently the package only converts from native MMH files to
FBX, 3DS, DAE, OBJ formats which are probably the most widely
interoperable formats used in the industry.  It also can export MMH.XML files which can be compiled using the tools provided by Bioware in its Dragon Age toolkit.
